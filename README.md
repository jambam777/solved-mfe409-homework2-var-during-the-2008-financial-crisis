<h2>      VaR during the 2008 Financial Crisis</h2>

All major banks use Value-at-Risk as a measure of market risk. As part of their disclosure to investors, banks report how they measure and manage market risk, including how they use Value-at-Risk. They also report on how their Value-atRisk models have performed. Each study group is assigned to a bank as follows and reponsible for summarizing the VaR used by these banks during the 2008 financial crisis. Your group number can be found in the attached list.

 <li>Download their 2008 annual reports (10-K for US firms and 20-F or 6-K forforeign firms) from SEC’s website <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html">(https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)</a>. Find the section where market risk is discussed and write a short essay summarizing the bank’s practices concerning the following:</li>

<ul>

 <li>Technique used to compuate VaR</li>

 <li>What data is used to compuate VaR? Is more recent data weighted more heavily?</li>

 <li>Time horizon</li>

 <li>Confidence level</li>

 <li>Number of VaR exceptions in 2008 (days where loss exceeded VaR)</li>

 <li>Any changes to VaR methodology made as a result of the financial crisis?</li>

</ul>

<ol start="2">

 <li>Download the daily stock price for the corresponding bank over 2006-2008 from Yahoo finance.

  <ul>

   <li>On each day of 2008, compute the 99% 1-day VaR for the stock returnusing the historical method with all past data in the sample.</li>

   <li>If you are at the end of 2008 and want to back-test this approach,what do you do and what do you conclude?</li>

   <li>Comment on the relation with what you found in the annual report.</li>

  </ul></li>

 <li>Add to your dataset the daily stock price for all 10 banks over the sameperiod.

  <ul>

   <li>Use the historical method to compute the VaR for a portfolio with$2m in the odd-numbered banks (1, 3, …), $1m in the even-numbered banks.</li>

   <li>Compute the DVaR and CVaR for each bank.</li>

   <li>Comment on the results.</li>

   <li>If you had to make a recommendation on how to tilt this portfolio,what would it be based on the data you have?</li>

  </ul></li>

</ol>

<h2>2       Expected shortfall</h2>

<ol>

 <li>Derive a formula for the expected shortfall if gains are normally distributed</li>

</ol>

.

<ol start="2">

 <li>The expected shortfall can also be defined as the average of the VaR forall confidence level above <em>c</em>:</li>

</ol>

Prove that this definition is equivalent to the one we have seen in class. <em>Hint: You can use integration by part and a change of variable.</em>
